        <li><strong>What happened</strong>:
            <p>D-Day, occurring on June 6, 1944, was a pivotal moment in World War II when Allied forces
                launched a massive amphibious invasion of German-occupied France. 
                Codenamed Operation Overlord, the invasion involved over 156,000 troops from the United States, 
                the United Kingdom, Canada, and other Allied nations landing on five beachheads along the 
                Normandy coast. The operation began with extensive aerial and naval bombardment, followed by 
                the landing of troops and the deployment of paratroopers behind enemy lines. Despite fierce 
                German resistance, the Allies achieved a foothold in Europe, which marked the beginning of the 
                end for Nazi Germany. D-Day is remembered as one of the largest and most complex military 
                operations in history and played a crucial role in the liberation of Western Europe.
